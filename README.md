# ConsoleGame-Legacy

This is a really old project that I built a pretty long time ago when I was trying to make a kind of roguelike game but with more traditional JRPG features like 1990s era style combat menus, random battles instead of enemies already existing in the dungeon and ATB (Active Time Battle) where spells or actions would take a certain amount of time and it was possible for an action to allow a monster to attack more than once.

The code is pretty weird at times and it was probably my first "big" project with C#. I never finished it because I had to stop for a few months and when I came back, I had trouble understanding half of what I wrote and how it all "fit" together.

You need .netCore framework 1.1.3 to run it (2.1 worked for me though) as it is pretty old

controls are easy (left, right, bottom and up arrows to move, "b" to start a battle and then you get the usual menu)

It is not finished, the battle doesn't "end", there is no item menu or way to "run away" from battle
